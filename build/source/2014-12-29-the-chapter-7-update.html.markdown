title: The Chapter 7 Update
date: 2014-12-29

I've been looking forward to releasing the Chapter 7 update and it's finally out! Along with the expected minor bug fixes and some small art and story improvements, this update includes an entirely new chapter containing 12 all new puzzles along with the continuation of the story. Mr. Tubbsworth is a rather eccentric fellow who employs an unorthodox wait staff as you can see in the promo art for the chapter below.

In this chapter, we learn lots of exciting new information about the characters, such as SOMEONE's lack of table manners...

And Penny's journey takes a twist when things get heated at Mr. Tubbsworth's supper party.
